External Libraries - 
1. Volley - I used Volley for my HTTP request for simplicity. It automatically handles a queue, and only took a minute to include. We also used it at my last job, so I knew about it beforehand.
2. Play Services:Location - As far as I know, this is the only baked-in "location-getter" with Android. I generally try and stick to Google provided solutions when working with Android.
3. Appcompat - I used AppCompat for Fragments. I knew swiping between screens is easy with fragments, so that's the design I went with.
